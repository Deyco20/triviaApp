# Trivia App Project

A dynamic, responsive trivia quiz application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as part of a web development project.


## ðŸš€ Features

* **Dynamic Setup:** Users can customize their quiz by:
    * Category (loaded dynamically from the API)
    * Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
    * Question Type (Multiple Choice, True/False)
    * Number of Questions
* **15-Second Timer:** Each question has a 15-second countdown timer. If the time runs out, the question is marked as incorrect.
* **Instant Feedback:** Users receive immediate visual feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect) after each answer.
* **Persistent History:** Game results (score, time taken) are saved to `localStorage` and displayed in a history list.
* **Modular Code:** The JavaScript code is structured into modules (`api.js`, `ui.js`, `main.js`) for readability and maintainability.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is mobile-first and adapts to all screen sizes, from phones to desktops.
